# Face Recognition Attendance System

## Overview
This project is a face recognition-based attendance system using OpenCV, face_recognition, and Tkinter. It allows users to register their faces, mark attendance, and manage registered users by editing or deleting their IDs.

## Features
- Live video streaming
- Face registration
- Automatic face encoding and recognition
- Attendance marking with timestamp
- User management (edit or delete registered IDs)

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Numpy
- face_recognition
- Pandas
- Tkinter
- PIL (Pillow)

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy face-recognition pandas pillow
```

## Usage

### Run the Application
```bash
python face_recognition_attendance.py
```

### Register a Face
1. Click the `Register` button.
2. Enter the user's name when prompted.
3. The system will capture an image and save it.

### Mark Attendance
1. Click the `Mark Attendance` button.
2. The system will detect faces and record attendance.
3. Attendance records are saved in `attendance.csv`.

### Manage Registered IDs
1. Click the `Edit/Delete ID` button.
2. Enter the name of the registered user.
3. Choose to delete the ID if found.
